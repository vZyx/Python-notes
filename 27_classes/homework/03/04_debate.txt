In a debate with a college:
Be open for different views (e.g, 2 ways for the data members)
Defend your choices with logical reasons
Also understand your college choices & reasons
A lot of areas are just vague. We may not know which direction is definitely the right way
Minor design concerns are not like big ones. System design is more risky than a class design
Find someone with more experience to help you make decisions
Or put time limit: discuss for an hour, then vote.
Red flag if discussions are very lengthy with a few "action items"
