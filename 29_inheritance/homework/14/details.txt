This problem is known as an The Class Explosion Problem

We could easily from the begin build one class and keep changing it so that it has boolean in the constructor for:
    - is thread-safe? is logging? is caching?
    
- But this means we have a huge code with several reasons to change = mess

- When we tried to follow design guidelines = every time we expanded the tree leaves with more classes to support a new feature

- Here is another real case

- "Large inheritance hierarchies in general, and deep ones in particular, are confusing to understand and therefore difficult to maintain. "
- "Inheritance is a design-time decision and trades off a lot of runtime flexibility."
