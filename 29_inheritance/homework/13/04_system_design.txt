- Scalability is a critical key to the success of the business. Let's think about it for the following 2 choices
- Assume we have 10 Million mobile users, say of 15 different types of mobiles


Choice 1: Each app periodically contacts the server to see if there are new notifications or not
- As mobiles are creating the requests, this means the server is receiving periodically millions of requests
- 2 critical problems here
- The server will be very slow to handle "concurrent requests" of such size
- Most of the time there won't be messages to notify


Choice 2: When a user opens his mobile game, he sends to the Game to register for messages to get notifications
- The server provides an API for apps to register or de-register
- When there is a message, the server loops on them and just notify
- Each device type might need a special code to send notifications
