Consider a doubly linked list of the stack
We can easily have extra pointer that points to the middle
With push or pop, we shift it a single step
Using next/previous, we can delete it in O(1)



Side note:
Clean operation is O(1) in stack-array to REUSE it
But linked-list is O(n) to remove all first


so as u see, overall trade-offs
